# Fashion Dataset

## Data Cleaning Overview

This project involves the comprehensive and professional cleaning of a fashion dataset to ensure it is ready for analysis or machine learning tasks. The cleaning process includes a series of advanced data preprocessing techniques aimed at improving the datasetâ€™s quality, consistency, and reliability.

## Key Steps in the Data Cleaning Process:

### 1. **Handling Missing Values**  
Identifying and imputing missing or incomplete data to ensure no critical information is lost. Methods such as mean, median, or domain-specific imputation are applied where appropriate.

### 2. **Removing Duplicates**  
Identifying and eliminating exact and near-duplicate records to prevent bias in subsequent analysis.

### 3. **Outlier Detection and Handling**  
Using statistical methods to detect and appropriately handle outliers, ensuring that extreme values do not skew the data distribution.

### 4. **Data Standardization and Formatting**  
Standardizing column formats (e.g., date, numerical, and categorical data), ensuring consistency across the dataset. This includes transforming text into a uniform case and correcting inconsistent naming conventions.

### 5. **Categorical Data Encoding**  
Converting categorical variables into numerical formats using methods such as one-hot encoding or label encoding to prepare the dataset for machine learning algorithms.

### 6. **Text Data Cleaning**  
Removing unnecessary characters, extra spaces, and standardizing text fields to improve the quality of product descriptions, brand names, and other textual features.

### 7. **Feature Engineering**  
Generating new features based on existing data to provide more meaningful insights, such as extracting size ranges, product categories, or sales periods from available columns.

### 8. **Consistency and Integrity Checks**  
Applying data validation rules to ensure logical consistency between related fields, such as ensuring product prices are positive and within expected ranges.
